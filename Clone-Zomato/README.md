Welcome to the **Zomato Clone** – a modern, full-stack food delivery platform, reimagined for security, scalability, and developer delight! This project fuses a beautiful React.js frontend with a robust DevSecOps pipeline, making it the perfect playground for learning, experimenting, and deploying like a pro.

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

- **Sleek, Intuitive UI**: Effortless browsing, ordering, and tracking.
- **DevSecOps-First**: Security checks and automation baked into CI/CD.
- **Containerized & Cloud-Ready**: Deploy anywhere, anytime.
- **React.js Power**: Built with Create React App for rapid development.
- **Production-Grade**: Optimized builds, best practices, and ready for real-world use.

> **Level up your DevOps and frontend skills with a project that’s as fun as it is practical!**
